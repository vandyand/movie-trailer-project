# Movie Trailer Project
I created a simple website for displaying movie previews. This project is a part of the Udacity.com Full Stack Web 
Developer Nanodegree. Here are a list of steps I took to set up the site:

* [media.py](https://github.com/vandyand/movie-trailer-project/blob/master/media.py) contains the Movies class which is the template for holding data about the movie such as title and trailer url.
* [entertainment_center.py](https://github.com/vandyand/movie-trailer-project/blob/master/entertainment_center.py) calls the Movies class to create objects for several movies like Toy Story and Avatar.
* [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/vandyand/movie-trailer-project/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) is used to generate the html code and display the site on a web browser via the webbrowser module.

## How to Use
Simply clone the repository to your system and run entertainment_center.py.
Note: All files must be in the same directory.
