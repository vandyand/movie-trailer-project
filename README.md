# Movie Trailer Project
I created a simple website for displaying movie previews. This project is a part of the Udacity.com Full Stack Web 
Developer Nanodegree. Here are a list of steps I took to set up the site:
* media.py contains the Movies class which is the template for holding data about the movie such as title and trailer url.
* entertainment_center.py calls the Movies class to create objects for several movies like Toy Story and Avatar.
* fresh_tomatoes.py is used to generate the html code and display the site on a web browser via the webbrowser module.
Enjoy!
